========

A twitter bot written in Clojure using a Markov chain to generate wierd tweets. All the code is from the great
tutorial by Carin Meier at "How I Start", check it out at: https://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1

By creating this repository I am not trying to steal credit for the code from Carins tutorial or claim that I wrote it myself in any way,
my intention is just to use it as a way to track my progress trough the tutorial and maybe to be able to create some branch-off experiments
on my own after I have learned a bit more about it.
